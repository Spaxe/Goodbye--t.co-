Goodbye, t.co!
==============
This is a quick and dirty Chrome Extension to replace any `*://t.co/*` links with the intended destination.  When I have time I'll properly package it.

Installation & Usage
--------------------
Open Chrome, locate **Tools -> Extensions**.  On the top right, **enable Developer Mode**

Select **Load unpacked extension...** and open the folder of the clone of this repo.

Refresh your Twitter Web UI and enjoy the abscense of t.co!
